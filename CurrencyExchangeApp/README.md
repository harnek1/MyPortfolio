The StreamWatch Application is a useful resource for fans of movies and TV shows. Users of this web app can search for their favorite movies, TV shows, and upcoming releases. 
When users locate a movie or TV show that catches their interest, they can save it to a favorite list. The app was completed in my Senior Engineering Project class at McMaster University. 
The application uses ASP.NET Core, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, Bootstrap, Razor, and Migrations.

The SuperHero App allows the user to search for Marvel and DC superheroes and Villains. The app uses React and JavaScript and it was completed in my Advanced Web Programming class at McMaster University.

The Web_Assignment10 was a class assignment for my Advanced Web Programming class. The assignment lets the user to search for houses based on price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and by city. 
The assignment also has a chatbot and uses JavaScript and Web Sockets.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
